\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Task / Research Question Description}
The task addressed by NameGuess is the automatic expansion of abbreviated column names into meaningful, descriptive labels in tabular data. This is particularly important to make open datasets easier to understand for non-technical users and downstream applications. For example, abbreviations like "Mdl" or "lst\_inspec\_mnth" need to be expanded to "Model" or "last inspection month," respectively. This task is framed as a natural language generation problem, leveraging large language models to understand contextual cues from tables and generate appropriate expansions. NameGuess addresses these complexities by using context from other columns and sampled data rows.

\subsection{Motivation \& Limitations of Existing Work}
Traditional methods have approached this problem using rule-based techniques or classification models that select the most likely expansion from a predefined set. However, these methods are inadequate when dealing with unseen abbreviations or ambiguous contexts. For example, the abbreviation "ACC" could mean "Account," "Accuracy," or "Acceleration" based on the other columns in the table. Previous models lacked adaptability and failed to utilize contextual clues effectively. The NameGuess approach, by using a generative model like GPT-Neo, allows for a more dynamic and context-sensitive expansion process.

\subsection{Proposed Approach}
NameGuess uses GPT-Neo (2.7B) as the language model for generating expanded column names. The dataset used for training consists of over 384,000 abbreviation-expansion pairs, derived from public tabular data, including open datasets from cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The model is conditioned on the table schema as well as representative rows, allowing it to infer the appropriate expansion by leveraging context. We used prompt-based techniques, creating prompt templates that include the abbreviated term, table schema, and sample rows to guide the model in generating accurate expansions.

\subsection{Challenges and Mitigations}
We faced several challenges during the reproduction of the original results:

\textbf{Dataset Construction:} Since the original dataset was not available, we recreated it using similar open datasets. We ensured that our recreated dataset contained diverse abbreviation patterns and contexts similar to those described in the original work. Evaluation datasets like `eval\_chicago.json`, `eval\_la.json`, and `eval\_sf.json` helped us verify the model's robustness and accuracy.

\textbf{Model Training Environment:} The original model's training environment utilized specific GPU configurations and gradient accumulation strategies, which we could not replicate exactly. Instead, we adjusted our setup to fit the available hardware (NVIDIA A100), running multiple experiments to identify stable checkpoints.

\textbf{Randomness Sensitivity:} The model's output was sensitive to random seed variation, especially for ambiguous abbreviations. To mitigate this, we ran multiple evaluation rounds and used averaging techniques to ensure the stability of our final reported results.

\section{Related Work}
Previous work by Gorman and Foster (2021) explored abbreviation expansion by treating it as a classification problem. This restricted the model’s flexibility and made it difficult to adapt to new or more complex abbreviations. Yin and Yu (2020) proposed a method for understanding tabular data for question answering, but their approach did not address the need for generating expanded labels for abbreviations. The work by Koutras and Papadimitriou (2021) on schema matching focused on aligning columns between disparate datasets, but it did not tackle the challenge of dynamically generating column labels. NameGuess builds on these previous works by incorporating a generative model capable of understanding contextual clues from the table schema and sample values, making it more versatile for real-world applications.

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Datasets}
We used evaluation data from a combination of curated datasets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Chicago Open Data**: Contains 9,218 examples with abbreviated column names and their expanded forms. This dataset emphasizes public records, such as building permits and public health data.
    \item **Los Angeles Open Data**: Focuses on fiscal records and transaction-related tables, where abbreviation ambiguity is common. It provided challenging examples involving financial terms.
    \item **San Francisco Open Data**: Involves geographical, administrative, and transportation datasets. These required context-aware expansions, especially for department abbreviations and street names.
\end{itemize}

In constructing our dataset, we used abbreviation rules and samples from `abbreviation\_samples.json` and `acronym\_samples.json`, which provided examples based on frequency of use. These files helped us ensure coverage across different domains and reduced the generalization gap between training and evaluation.

\subsection{Implementation}
The implementation of NameGuess involved several key components:

\textbf{Model Choice and Framework:} We selected GPT-Neo (2.7B) from the Hugging Face library, as it is an autoregressive model capable of handling the type of generation required for abbreviation expansion. The Hugging Face Transformers framework was used to fine-tune the model, which allowed us to efficiently modify the pre-trained weights for the specific task at hand.

\textbf{Data Preprocessing:} The provided datasets needed significant preprocessing to match the requirements of the model. We wrote custom scripts to clean the data, ensure that abbreviations were properly mapped to expanded forms, and handle missing values. Abbreviations with multiple plausible meanings were tagged to assist in contextual inference. The data preprocessing also involved tokenization using the GPT-Neo tokenizer to ensure compatibility with the model.

\textbf{Prompt Templates and Input Construction:} We designed prompt templates to guide the model effectively. Each prompt consisted of examples of abbreviations, their expanded forms, and the context from related columns and sample rows. For instance, for the abbreviation "PRJTP," the prompt included other columns like "Project Budget" and "Project Start Date," which helped the model infer the correct expansion. We experimented with different styles of prompts, adding and removing contextual clues to maximize model performance.

\textbf{Training and Fine-Tuning:} We used PyTorch for model fine-tuning. The training process involved a combination of supervised learning with teacher forcing, where the correct expansions were provided during training. We ran the model for multiple epochs, adjusting hyperparameters like the learning rate, batch size, and gradient clipping to stabilize the training. To save computational resources, we used gradient accumulation, which was particularly helpful given the large model size and limited GPU memory.

\textbf{Evaluation Pipeline:} Our evaluation was automated using `run\_eval.py`, which integrated prompt templates and abbreviation examples with the model interface. We used standard metrics like exact match (EM) and F1 score to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of the generated expansions. Evaluation was performed on all three datasets separately to understand domain-specific performance variations.

\end{table}

The reproduced model achieved results similar to the original study, but with minor deviations (1-2\%) in exact match and F1 scores. These discrepancies are likely due to differences in hardware and model configurations. Despite these challenges, the reproduced trends closely matched those reported in the original paper, suggesting the approach is largely reproducible.

\subsection{Discussion}
Our findings show that model performance is highly sensitive to prompt construction, indicating the importance of prompt engineering for abbreviation expansion tasks. Specifically, we found that:

\textbf{Role of Prompt Templates:} The quality of the prompt had a significant effect on the results. For abbreviations that were ambiguous, such as “mnthRprtd,” it was essential to provide clear and sufficient context in the prompt. We experimented with different types of prompt templates, including using various numbers of examples in the prompt, and found that adding more representative examples improved performance.

\textbf{Dataset Consistency:} Constructing a dataset that accurately reflected real-world scenarios was critical for successful reproduction. We observed that our dataset’s diversity, in terms of domain and abbreviation structure, helped the model generalize better compared to previous, more limited approaches.

\textbf{Sensitivity to Context Ambiguity:} The model often failed when the context was too ambiguous or when similar abbreviations had multiple plausible meanings. This highlights the need for improvements in model training to better understand nuanced contextual differences.

\subsection{Resources}
The reproduction process required approximately 200 GPU hours on NVIDIA A100 machines. Due to the significant computational requirements of fine-tuning a model of this size, we had to adapt some training parameters to match available resources. The original paper utilized V100 GPUs, which provided slightly different optimizations, possibly contributing to the small deviations observed in the reproduced metrics. To ensure fair comparison, we kept detailed logs of training and evaluation processes, which allowed us to pinpoint the differences and report them transparently.

\subsection{Error Analysis}
The error analysis revealed several common issues in the model predictions:

\textbf{Ambiguity in Expansions:} Many abbreviations, such as "PRJTP" (which could mean "Project Type" or "Projected Total"), were challenging for the model due to lack of clear context. The model often defaulted to the most common expansion seen during training, resulting in errors. To improve this, future models could use additional attention mechanisms or pre-trained knowledge graphs that help differentiate ambiguous terms based on more context.

\textbf{Context Dependence Issues:} The model's performance dropped when neighboring columns did not provide adequate cues. For instance, abbreviations like "DT" were expanded inconsistently as "Date" or "District," depending on what other information was present. Adding more explicit training examples that emphasized the need for contextual interpretation could mitigate this issue.

\textbf{Pattern Dependence and Domain-Specific Challenges:} We observed that the model relied heavily on previously seen patterns. Configuration settings from `cryptifier\_config.json` were used to improve domain-specific abbreviation expansion accuracy, but they did not generalize well across different types of datasets. Incorporating a more diverse set of training data from varied domains may help improve generalizability.

\section{Robustness Study}

\subsection{Approach}
To assess the robustness of our model, we introduced several modifications to the evaluation data:

\textbf{Typographical Errors:} We deliberately added typographical errors to simulate real-world data-entry mistakes. This included misspellings like changing "Accnt" to "Acount" or "FYear" to "FYer."

\textbf{Synonym Replacements and Variations:} We replaced commonly used column header words with synonyms, such as replacing "Amount" with "Value" and "Date" with "Timestamp." This tested whether the model could adapt to subtle changes in input terminology.

\textbf{Column Reordering:} We shuffled the order of the columns to test whether the model relied on the position of columns rather than truly understanding their relationships.

\subsection{Results of Robustness Evaluation}
The robustness evaluation yielded the following insights:

\textbf{Sensitivity to Typos:} When abbreviations included minor typographical errors, the model’s accuracy dropped significantly to 58\%. This suggests that the model relies too heavily on exact string matches rather than leveraging contextual understanding to correct minor spelling mistakes.

\textbf{Column Position Dependence:} The model also showed a notable drop in accuracy when columns were reordered. This indicates that the model partially relied on the order of columns rather than fully understanding the context. Enhancing the model to understand semantic relationships between columns may help mitigate this reliance.

\textbf{Comparison with GPT-4:} Compared to GPT-4, which maintained over 70\% accuracy under the same perturbations, our reproduced GPT-Neo model was less resilient. GPT-4 demonstrated a better capacity to adapt to real-world noise, highlighting the advances in more recent generative architectures.

\subsection{Discussion}
The robustness study shows that the model’s training should incorporate noisy data, such as typos and randomized column positions, to improve its resilience. Adding noise to training data could help the model become more tolerant of inconsistencies that are common in real-world datasets. Moreover, synonym replacement in the prompts might be included during training to improve the model's ability to generalize. Adversarial training methods, where the model is trained with difficult examples, could also prove beneficial for increasing the robustness of the expansion mechanism.

\section{Workload Clarification}
The workload was divided evenly between both authors:

\textbf{Abhiram Mullapudi} was responsible for dataset processing, training the model, running experiments, and hyperparameter tuning. 

\textbf{Sasank Sandeep Padamata} focused on robustness evaluations, error analysis, and report writing. Both authors worked on prompt engineering and dataset curation.

\section{Conclusion}
This reproducibility study demonstrated that NameGuess is largely reproducible, with results that closely match the original study. Slight deviations in performance were noted, likely due to differences in hardware and training configurations. The model struggles with ambiguous abbreviations and lacks robustness when faced with noisy inputs. 

Future work should focus on enhancing prompt design and incorporating more diverse training examples to cover edge cases like ambiguous abbreviations. Leveraging more advanced architectures like GPT-4 and introducing noisy data during training could further enhance model robustness. Overall, generative models like GPT-Neo hold promise for abbreviation expansion, but improvements are needed for real-world applicability.
